        suspiciously for a minute and then said, 'Twenty-six. Eight hunnerd and forty eighty.' His mother lifted her
        head from the book. 'Four,' she said, smiling fondly at the little boy. 'Is that so?' the man said politely to
        the little boy. 'Twenty-six.' He nodded his head at the mother across the aisle. 'Is that your mother?' The
        little boy leaned forward to look and then said, 'Yes, that's her.' 'What's your name?' the man asked. The
        little boy looked suspicious again. 'Mr. Jesus,' he said. (Shirley Jackson, 'The Witch.' The Lottery and Other
